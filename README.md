# Bad Code Snippets

These snippets of code are intended to trigger a CodeQL finding inside a pull request. These are short snippets that include entire data flows and vulnerabilities.

## How to use
You can introduce any one of the snippets as a pull request inside your existing repository. Simply copy one of the snippets (the whole file), create a new file in your repository, paste this vulnerable code in, then commit to a new branch. You will be prompted to create a pull request. During the PR, CodeQL will identify the vulnerability and generate a fix.

**NOTE:** This is vulnerable code. Make sure not to commit it directly to the main branch of your production repos :)
